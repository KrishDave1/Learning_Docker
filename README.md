# Learning_Docker

### Before Docker
1. Installation process different on each OS environment
2. If there are 10 services then there are many steps where something could go wrong

### With Docker
1. Own isolated environment
2. Packaged with all needed configurations
3. One same command to run on all OS environments
4. Can also run same app with 2 different versions of a service
